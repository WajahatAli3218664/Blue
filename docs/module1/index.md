# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1! In this module, you'll learn about ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system of modern robots, enabling communication between different components.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes and topics
- Integrate URDF models with Python agents
- Build a basic robotic communication system

## Module Overview

ROS 2 is the backbone of modern robotics, providing:
- **Distributed Communication**: Nodes can run on different machines
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Critical for robotic applications
- **Language Flexibility**: Support for Python, C++, and more
- **Scalability**: From single robots to robot swarms

## Topics in This Module

1. **[ROS 2 Nodes & Topics](./nodes-topics)** - Learn the fundamental building blocks
2. **[URDF & Python Agent Integration](./urdf-integration)** - Connect 3D models with intelligent agents

## Hardware Requirements

- **Development**: Any modern computer with Ubuntu 20.04+ or Docker
- **Recommended**: RTX-enabled workstation for advanced simulations
- **Edge Deployment**: Jetson Orin Nano for real-world applications

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts
