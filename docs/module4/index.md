# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4! Learn to integrate natural language processing with robotic actions using Vision-Language-Action models.

## Learning Objectives

- Implement voice-to-action systems
- Use LLMs for cognitive planning
- Build multimodal AI systems
- Deploy VLA models on edge devices

## Topics in This Module

1. **[Voice-to-Action](./voice-to-action)** - Natural language robot control

## Overview

VLA models enable robots to:
- **Understand Natural Language**: Process voice commands and text instructions
- **Visual Understanding**: Interpret scenes and objects
- **Action Generation**: Convert understanding into robot actions
- **Cognitive Reasoning**: Plan complex multi-step tasks
